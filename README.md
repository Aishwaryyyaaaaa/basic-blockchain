# Blockchain Simulation

This project demonstrates a simple blockchain simulation that mimics the core features of a blockchain. The simulation includes features such as block creation, block validation, proof-of-work, and tampering detection.

## Features:
- Simple blockchain structure with linked blocks using SHA-256 hashing
- Proof-of-work algorithm (for block mining)
- Transaction simulation (dummy data for blockchain)
- Blockchain validation to detect tampering
